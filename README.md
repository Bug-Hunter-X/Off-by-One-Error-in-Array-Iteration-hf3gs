# Off-by-One Error in Java Array Iteration

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over an array.  The buggy code attempts to sum the elements of an array but incorrectly iterates beyond the array's bounds, leading to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The corrected code demonstrates the proper way to iterate within the array's valid index range.
